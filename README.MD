# TO GENERATE OPENSSL KEY VALUE PAIRS 

(multiples of 2)(2048*2)=4096 bit to encrypt larger size data

create the folder with name of your choice 
go to the comand prompt with that folder path , then type or paste below comands , inside the folder you could see both the files generated by name private_key and public_key

# 1) and 2) are the below comnds to be used 2048 is the size of the key im intrested here, like wise you can increase it by multiplying it by 2 and replace it with :2048 eg:-(2048*2)=4096 

1)openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

2)openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
